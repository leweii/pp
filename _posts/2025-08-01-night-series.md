Nocturnal explorations of urban and natural spaces. This collection captures the unique atmosphere and quality of light found after dark.

Working with long exposures and available light sources, these photographs reveal a world transformed by darkness. The night reveals details and moods invisible during daylight hours.

Each image invites contemplation of the spaces we inhabit and how they change when the sun sets.
