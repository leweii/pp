An exploration of urban environments and architectural forms. This series captures the geometric patterns and light interactions found in contemporary cityscapes.

The project was shot over the course of two years, documenting various metropolitan areas and their unique architectural character. Each image focuses on the interplay between natural and artificial light within built environments.

Through careful composition and attention to detail, these photographs aim to reveal the subtle beauty hidden within everyday urban spaces.
