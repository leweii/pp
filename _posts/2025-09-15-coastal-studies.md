A meditation on the boundary between land and sea. This ongoing series examines the coastal landscape through minimal compositions and long exposures.

The work investigates the transient nature of shorelines and the constant movement of water against solid forms. Shot primarily during twilight hours, these images capture moments of transition and transformation.

The series emphasizes the eternal rhythm of tides and the marks they leave upon the landscape.
