An intimate study of wooded landscapes and the play of light through tree canopies. This series delves into the serene atmosphere of forest environments.

Shot across different seasons, these images document the changing character of woodland spaces. The work focuses on the vertical structures of trees and the filtered quality of light within dense vegetation.

Through these photographs, I aim to convey the sense of solitude and contemplation found in forested areas.
