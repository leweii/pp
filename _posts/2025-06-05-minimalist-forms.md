A study in reduction and simplicity. This project explores minimal compositions and the essential elements of form, space, and light.

Each photograph strips away unnecessary details to reveal fundamental geometric relationships. The work investigates how minimal elements can create maximum visual impact.

Through careful framing and attention to negative space, these images demonstrate the power of simplicity in visual communication.
